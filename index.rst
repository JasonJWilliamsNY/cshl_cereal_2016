Get Started with CyVerse
========================

**Half-day workshop materials**

|image0| ## Welcome to CyVerse!

**CyVerse Vision:** Transforming science through data-driven discovery.
**CyVerse Mission:** Design, deploy, and expand a national
cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research and train scientists in
its use.

CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational
infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus
enabling data-driven discovery. Our powerful extensible platforms
provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, image analyses, cloud
services, APIs, and more.

CyVerse is of, by, and for the community, and community-driven needs
shape our mission. We rely on your feedback to provide the
infrastructure you need most to advance your science, development, and
educational agenda.

While originally created with the name iPlant Collaborative to serve
U.S. plant science communities, CyVerse cyberinfrastructure is germane
to all life sciences disciplines and works equally well on data from
plants, animals, or microbes. By democratizing access to supercomputing
capabilities, we provide a crucial resource to enable scientists to find
solutions for the future.

Getting Started Guide
---------------------

In this guide we will cover brief tutorials and documentation that will
get you started using CyVerse tools and services right away. These
tutorials will focus on 5 major applications and resources.

-  `Account creation and setup <./cyverse_account_creation.md>`__
-  `Uploading and importing, and managing data <>`__
-  `Using Discovery Environment (web-interface to data, tools, and
   analysis <>`__
-  `Using Atmosphere cloud computing <>`__
-  `Understanding CyVerse help resources and policies <>`__

Importantly, we **will not** cover some other key cyberinfrastructure
components but you should be aware of them:

-  `Managing images with BISQUE <>`__
-  `Classroom-friendly bioinformatics with DNA Subway <>`__
-  `Developers resources with Agave API <>`__
