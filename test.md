#Data upload - Import your data using Cyberduck


**Cyberduck – The easiest way to get your data uploaded to CyVerse**

There are several methods to get data into the CyVerse data store. In
this packet, we will only cover Cyberduck – a user-friendly standalone
application that can serve the majority of use cases for the majority of
users. Feel free to upload any data you wish to analyze, especially in
the context of the workshop. If you don’t have sample data, just upload
any document as a test.

> **Note:** If you prefer to use command line interfaces to the data
> store, see the iCommands documentation on the iPlant Learning Center
> or Wiki. Try installing and configuring iCommands and doing some
> simple data transfers. More details will be covered at the workshop.
